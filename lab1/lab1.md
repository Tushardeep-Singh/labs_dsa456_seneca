** What did you like/not like about Python
I personally like the syntax of c++ and python's syntax is over-simplified for me. I feel curly braces provide much more visual meaning to code blocks than just indentation. For me, if I read someone's code, then if curly braces are used it is much easier to focus on a part of code. 
It is so straight-forward to run a python code whereas, c++ requires compilation and then we can run the executable.

** Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?
In lab1, wherever I used while loops, before that I started solving those problems using for loops and I did not expect the for loops to increment the variable themselves without us typing in the increment(++i, i++ invalid syntax in python).
Then, it seemed that it was easier to format the solution using while loop so I used while loops.

** Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.
Similarities:
    1. The functioning of the loops is same, though the syntax is a bit different.
    2. 'self'(can be changed as per wish) in python and 'this' in c++ provide the same functionality of providing us a handle to the instance of a class on which the method was executed.
Differences:
    1. The syntax differs alot:
        1.1: 'function' in c++, 'def' in python
        1.2: 'self' in python, 'this' in c++
    2. ++ operator can not be used in python but is available in c++. Hence, pre-increment (++i) and post-increment(i++) syntax is invalid in python.

Though, me as an individual would more or less use the same logic if I tried solving the same problems using c++, but absence of defining the variables without data types in python would make coding much more comforting as compared to c++. Though c++ has 'auto' keyword but writing no data type than writing one, is still better.
